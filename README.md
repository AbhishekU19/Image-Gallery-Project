# Image-Gallery-Project
This is a simple image gallery project created using HTML and CSS. It features a responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes and a clean layout that allows users to easily navigate through the images.

The gallery includes multiple image categories, and each category is displayed in its own section. Users can hover over an image to see a caption, and clicking on an image will display it in a modal window with a larger size.

The project was built with HTML and CSS, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks. The code is clean and well-organized, making it easy for others to understand and modify as needed.

To view the project, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. Feel free to use this project as a starting point for your own image gallery or as a learning resource for HTML and CSS.
